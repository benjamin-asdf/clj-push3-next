# Brian Development Is A Program Synthesis

- Cognition is a kind of software, created in a software synthesis task during development. 

- The question of brain software is one of knowledge creation, where does the ad-hoc design of brain software come from? 
- Piaget's genetic epistemology

# Elegance Is The Missing Link Between Aesthetics, Art, Science, Creativity

- Elegance is the property of good design. 
- The Vitruvian Triad is "durability, convenience, and beauty".
- Elegance is pragmatic, useful and *delightful*. 
- Elegance is mysterious, hangs together with truth, scientific discovery and art. 
- The best source code is usually not the shortest. But source code that displays 'artistic swag', 'conscinitious' or 'technical sweetness'. 

- In an epheremal notion beyond simplicity, the best design is self evident.

- Elegance in biology in my feel has something to do with the range of possible uses of a thing. An elegant design is one that let's one 
  *win* in the future. 
- Like planning for the unplanned to occur. Because problem solving in the real world is open ended. 

- Elegance is a creative problem and therefore open ended. I.e. there is no 'most elegant' solution to anything.
- The same way as we can always find out better theories of the world (Popper), we can find new creative ways of solving problems. 

# The Elegance Detector Hypothesis

- Conjecture: Brain circuits implement algorithms that provide heuristics for elegance. Hypothetical *elegance detectors* would exist.
- These are adapted, are encoded in the genome and can by definition not look at the content of mentality, only the hardware level implementation of it. 
- Idea #1: Time: By allowing a settled activity to inhibit all alternatives, the fastest program could win.
- Idea #2: Inhibition: The amount of inhibition an activity patterns sustains could be an indication of it's connectedness to the rest of the network, 
  making it an idea that 'fitst well' with the overall memory structure (~ world model) of the network.

- Braitenberg: Maybe tickle circuits were re-used as humor circuits, activated by elegance detectors, thereby being 'fun lines' that 
  the system can use for instance for it's reward model.

- Idea #3: Behaviour (programs) that feedback activity to their own selection would be autopoetic, if 'being stable activity':
  - Has to do with priming the correct sensors, it implements prediction and control. 
  - Has to do with pleasing darwinian wires, it has to do with being an effective animal controller. 
  - Has to do with gaining activity support from all available network, it has to do with recruiting the complete nervous system in a resourceful manner.
  












<!-- # The Holy Grail Of Software Synthesis -->

<!-- - Figure out the essential components of open ended   -->

<!-- ## Approach 1:  -->

<!-- - Figure out what evolved adaptations the brain uses for it's software synth. task.  -->
<!-- - Exract the essential features and use them in a model.  -->
<!-- - It is possible that the essentials include a cultural context.  -->
<!--   In this case part of the challange could be embedding the machine in a useful way in human culture?  -->
